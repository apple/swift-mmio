/// A type that provides access to a hardware memory-mapped register.
///
/// `Register` is the primary mechanism for interacting with a hardware register
/// whose layout and bit fields are defined by its `Value` type (which conforms
/// to ``RegisterValue``). It abstracts the details of volatile memory access
/// and offers methods for reading, writing, and modifying the register's
/// contents in a type-safe manner.
///
/// ```swift
/// // Create a register instance at a specific memory address
/// let statusRegister = DeviceStatus(unsafeAddress: 0x40000000)
///
/// // Read the current value
/// let status = statusRegister.read()
/// if status.enableFlag {
///     // Handle enabled state
/// }
///
/// // Write a new value
/// statusRegister.write { value in
///     value.enableFlag = true
///     value.mode = .normal
/// }
/// ```
///
/// All register accesses through Swift MMIO use volatile semantics to ensure
/// correct interaction with hardware. See <doc:Volatile-Access> for more
/// details.
///
///
/// - Parameter Value: A `struct`, typically defined using the
///   ``MMIO/Register(bitWidth:)`` macro, that describes the bit-level layout of
///   the hardware register.
