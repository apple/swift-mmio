import MMIOVolatile

/// A protocol identifying types suitable for underlying register storage and
/// capable of performing volatile memory operations.
///
/// `_RegisterStorage` is an internal protocol within Swift MMIO. It restricts
/// the set of types that can serve as the raw storage for a memory-mapped
/// register to those for which volatile load and store operations are
/// explicitly provided. This ensures that all hardware interactions maintain
/// correct volatile memory semantics, preventing unintended compiler
/// optimizations.
///
/// The conforming types are `UInt8`, `UInt16`, `UInt32`, and `UInt64`. These
/// correspond to the fixed-width integer types for which the `MMIOVolatile`
/// C module provides volatile access functions.
///
/// This protocol constrains the `Storage` associated type within
/// ``RegisterValueRaw``, forming a critical part of Swift MMIO's safety
/// mechanism for hardware interaction.
///
/// - Warning: This is an internal protocol. Do not attempt to conform new types
///   to `_RegisterStorage`.
///
/// See <doc:Volatile-Access>, for more background.

  /// pointed to by `pointer`.

  /// compiler and directly accesses the hardware memory location.
  ///
  /// - Parameter pointer: An `UnsafePointer` to the memory location (register
  ///   address) from which to read.
  ///
  /// - Returns: The value read from the memory location.
