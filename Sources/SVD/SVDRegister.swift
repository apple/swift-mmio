  /// You can use the register `<name>` only when both registers are in the

  /// String to identify the register. Register names are required to be

  public var description: String?
  /// Specifies a group name associated with all alternate register that have

  /// definition allocating the same absolute address in the address space.
  public var alternateGroup: String?
  /// This tag can reference a register that has been defined above to current
  /// location in the description and that describes the memory location
  /// already. This tells the SVDConv's address checker that the redefinition
  /// of this particular register is intentional. The register name needs to
  /// be unique within the scope of the current peripheral. A register
  /// description is defined either for a unique address location or could be
  /// a redefinition of an already described address. In the latter case, the
  /// register can be either marked alternateRegister and needs to have a
  /// unique name, or it can have the same register name but is assigned to a
  /// register subgroup through the tag alternateGroup (specified in version
  /// 1.0).

  /// Define the address offset relative to the enclosing element.

  /// It can be useful to assign a specific native C datatype to a register.
  /// This helps avoiding type casts. For example, if a 32 bit register shall
  /// act as a pointer to a 32 bit unsigned data item, then dataType can be
  /// set to `uint32_t *`.
  public var dataType: SVDDataType?
  /// Element to describe the manipulation of data written to a register. If
  /// not specified, the value written to the field is the value stored in the
  /// field. The other options define bitwise operations:
  public var modifiedWriteValues: SVDModifiedWriteValues?
  /// Mutually exclusive options exist to set write-constraints.
  public var writeConstraint: SVDWriteConstraint?
  /// If set, it specifies the side effect following a read operation. If not
  /// set, the register is not modified.
  ///
  /// Debuggers are not expected to read this register location unless
  /// explicitly instructed by the user.
  public var readAction: SVDReadAction?
  /// In case a register is subdivided into bit fields, it should be reflected
  /// in the SVD description file to create bit-access macros and bit-field
