/// The concept of enumerated values creates a map between unsigned integers and
/// an identifier string. In addition, a description string can be associated
/// with each entry in the map.
///
/// **Example**
/// - 0 `<->` disabled -> "The clock source clk0 is turned off."
/// - 1 `<->` enabled  -> "The clock source clk1 is running."
/// - 2 `<->` reserved -> "Reserved values. Do not use."
/// - 3 `<->` reserved -> "Reserved values. Do not use."
///
/// This information generates an enum in the device header file. The debugger
/// may use this information to display the identifier string as well as the
/// description. Just like symbolic constants making source code more readable,
/// the system view in the debugger becomes more instructive. The detailed
/// description can provide reference manual level details within the debugger.
@XMLElement

  /// Makes a copy from a previously defined enumeratedValues section. No
  /// modifications are allowed. An enumeratedValues entry is referenced by
  /// its name. If the name is not unique throughout the description, it needs
  /// to be further qualified by specifying the associated field, register,
  /// and peripheral as required.
  ///
  /// For example:
  ///  - `field:                           clk.dis_en_enum`
  ///  - `register + field:                ctrl.clk.dis_en_enum`

  /// enumeration type in the device header file. User is responsible for
  /// uniqueness across description.
