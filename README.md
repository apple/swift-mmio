# Swift MMIO

**Swift MMIO** is an open source package for defining and operating on memory mapped IO directly in Swift. 

## Sample Usage

Swift MMIO makes it easy to define registers directly in Swift source code and manipulate them in a safe and ergonomic manner.

```swift
@RegisterBank
struct Control {
  @RegisterBank(offset: 0x0)
  var cr1: Register<CR1>
  @RegisterBank(offset: 0x4)
  var cr2: Register<CR2>
}

@Register(bitWidth: 32)
struct CR1 {
  @ReadWrite(bits: 12..<13, as: Bool.self)
  var en: EN
}

let control = Control(unsafeAddress: 0x1000)
control.cr1.modify { $0.en = true }
```

## Using Swift MMIO in your project

Swift MMIO supports use with the Swift Package Manager. First, add the Swift MMIO repository to your Package's dependencies:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-mmio.git", from: "0.0.1"),
```

> **Important:** This project follows semantic versioning. While still in major version `0`, source-stability is only guaranteed within minor versions (e.g. between `0.0.3` and `0.0.4`). If you want to guard against potentially source-breaking package updates, you can specify your package dependency using `.upToNextMinor(from: "0.0.1")` as the requirement.:
>
> ```swift
> .package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-mmio.git", .upToNextMinor(from: "0.0.1")),
> ```

Second, add the `MMIO` library to your targets' dependencies:

```swift
.target(
  name: "DeviceRegisters",
  dependencies: [
    .product(name: "MMIO", package: "swift-mmio")
  ]),
```

Finally, `import MMIO` in your Swift source code.
